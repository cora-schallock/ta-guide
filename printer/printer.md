Before you can use the ICS printer/ scanner you will need to complete the following following:
1) Obtain a printer code for your course
2) Obtain a standard USB thumb drive with at least 50 mb of space
3) Upload a blank copy of the test you are wanting to print/ scan to the USB

## Location:
The printer is located on the first floor of [DBH](https://classrooms.uci.edu/classrooms/dbh/) in the copy center.
