## Preperation:
Before you can use the ICS printer/ scanner you will need to complete the following following:
1) Obtain a printer code for your course
2) Obtain a standard USB thumb drive with at least 50 mb of space
3) Upload a blank copy of the test you are wanting to print/ scan as a PDF document to the USB

## Location:
The printer is located on the first floor of [DBH](https://classrooms.uci.edu/classrooms/dbh/) in the copy center.

 Enter the lobby of DBH, and proceed through the set of double doors at the end of the lobby.

 Inside you will find two large [Rioch Pro 8300S printers](https://www.ricoh-usa.com/en/products/pl/equipment/commercial-industrial-printing/cutsheet)

  ## Printing:
  To print test follow the steps below:
  1) Wake up the printer by clicking on the energy saver button (moon ICON).

  2) On the right hand side of the number pad, insert your USB:

3) On the home screen navigate to the printer (classic). It is a blue icon:

4) Ensure there is an efficent ammount of paper. Spare paper can typically be found in the copy center's cubbies above the counter with the cutter.

5) Click "Print from Memory Storage Device" and select the PDF you are wanting to print:

7) Click "Detailed Settings"

8) On the "Edit" Tab select, 2-sided "Open to the Left"

9) On the "Finish" Tab, under staple select the icon that resembles a piece of paper with a staple in the upper left corner."

11) On the "Resolution" Tab select a dpi of atleast 600.

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/11_print_step_6.JPEG)

12) Use the keypad to enter the number of copies you would like to make. And hit "Ok":

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/13_print_step_8.JPEG)

13) Enter the printer code when prompted.

14) Look at the top of the screen. If you see a prompt that says "Remains" with a time, the job has begun. If not, try hitting the start key on the keypad. **Note: The printer can take a few minutes to warmup.**

15) Collect test on the Tray to the left.

16) Don't forget to bring your USB and tests when you leave!

Note: It is a good idea to print a test copy. If the test copy looks satifactory, repeat the steps above to print a large print job.
  
  ## Scanning:
  To scan the tests follow the steps below:
  1) Locate the cutter on the counter
  
 ![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/16_cut.JPEG)
  
  2) Using the cutter, cutoff the corner of the tests with the staples. **Important: You want to cut close to the staple, but make sure you are able to cut cleanly (i.e. won't hit the staple with the cutter blade). You can cut multiple tests at a time, make sure the tests are aligned and try not to exceed cutting 20 pages at once (or so). If any corners remain, remove them with the staple. Any staple feed through the scanner will interupt your scan job, and risk damaging the scanner**

  3) On the home screen, navigate to the scanner.

  4) Insert your USB

  ![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/20_usb.JPEG)
  
 5) Turn "Density" to the highest setting (the dark black rectangle).

  ![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/21_scan_step_1.JPEG)
  
  6) Click feed type, and under "2 sided original" select "Top to Top"

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/22_scan_step_2.JPEG)
  
  7) Click Batch **Note: Batch allows you to do multiple scans, and for all the scans to be concatenated into one large PDF. This is convient if you are uploading the test to a site like gradescope, that automaticcaly can take the large pdf and split it up**. And then click "OK"

  ![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/23_scan_step_3.JPEG)
  
  
 8) Click "Store Files" and then click "Store to Memory Device"
 9)

  8) Look at the scanning tray on the top of the Rioch printer. Notice the small black latch. This is what detects paper in the scan try, and adjusts the height automatically. If this lever is not tripped, the scan tray will not rise and the scanner will not detect pages to scan.

 9) Place your first batch of tests on the scanner. Try to limit the number of pages you scan at once to 75 or so. When the pages are in place and the tray has lifted, hit the start button to begin scanning.

10) Collect scanned tests from the bottom of the tray and set aside.

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/27_scanning.JPEG)

11) Begin scanning your next Batch. Note when you hit start, the page count will not begin at 0. Repeat this step until all tests are scanned.

12) **When done scanning, hit the enter key (the # symbol).**

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/30_scanning.JPEG)

13) The PDF will be written to the USB. For a large scan this may take a while, when complete the screen will be prompted with a message.

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/31_scanning.JPEG)

14) Click the USB symbol at the bottom right.

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/32_remove_usb.JPEG)

15) Select remove device.

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/33_remove_usb.JPEG)

16) When prompted remove your USB on the right hand side.

![alt text](https://github.com/cora-schallock/ta-guide/blob/main/printer/images/34_remove_usb_2.JPEG)

17) Don't forget to bring your USB or the original tests when you leave!
