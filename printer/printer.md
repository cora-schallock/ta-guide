## Preperation:
Before you can use the ICS printer/ scanner you will need to complete the following following:
1) Obtain a printer code for your course
2) Obtain a standard USB thumb drive with at least 50 mb of space
3) Upload a blank copy of the test you are wanting to print/ scan as a PDF document to the USB

## Location:
The printer is located on the first floor of [DBH](https://classrooms.uci.edu/classrooms/dbh/) in the copy center.

 **TODO: Insert Map**
 
 Enter the lobby of DBH, and proceed through the set of double doors at the end of the lobby.
 
 **TODO: Door Picture**
 
 Inside you will find two large [Rioch Pro 8300S printers](https://www.ricoh-usa.com/en/products/pl/equipment/commercial-industrial-printing/cutsheet)

15) Collect test on the Tray to the left.

Note: It is a good idea to print a test copy. If the test copy looks satifactory, repeat the steps above to print a large print job.
  
  ## Scanning:
  To scan the tests follow the steps below:
  1) Locate the cutter on the counter
  
  **TODO Insert Image**
  
  2) Using the cutter, cutoff the corner of the tests with the staples. **Important: You want to cut close to the staple, but make sure you are able to cut cleanly (i.e. won't hit the staple with the cutter blade). You can cut multiple tests at a time, make sure the tests are aligned and try not to exceed cutting 20 pages at once (or so). If any corners remain, remove them with the staple. Any staple feed through the scanner will interupt your scan job, and risk damaging the scanner**

  3) On the home screen, navigate to the scanner.

  **TODO Insert Image**
  
  7) Click Batch **Note: Batch allows you to do multiple scans, and for all the scans to be concatenated into one large PDF. This is convient if you are uploading the test to a site like gradescope, that automaticcaly can take the large pdf and split it up**

  **TODO Insert Image**
  
  8) Look at the scanning tray on the top of the Rioch printer. Notice the small black latch. This is what detects paper in the scan try, and adjusts the height automatically. If this lever is not tripped, the scan tray will not rise and the scanner will not detect pages to scan.

 **TODO Insert Image**
 
 9) Place your first batch of tests on the scanner. Try to limit the number of pages you scan at once to 75 or so. When the pages are in place and the tray has lifted, hit the start button to begin scanning.

**TODO Insert Image**

10) Collect scanned tests from the bottom of the tray and set aside.

**TODO Insert Image**

11) Begin scanning your next Batch. Note when you hit start, the page count will not begin at 0. Repeat this step until all tests are scanned.
